# Profile: Sublimation Printing

## Overview
Sublimation printing is a digital printing process that uses heat to transfer dye onto materials. The process converts solid dye directly into gas without passing through a liquid state (sublimation), allowing the dye to penetrate and bond with polyester fibers. This creates vibrant, durable prints that become part of the fabric rather than sitting on the surface.

## Key Properties
- **Color Vibrancy:** Exceptional. Brilliant, saturated colors with photographic quality.
- **Durability:** Excellent. Dye becomes part of fabric, won't crack, peel, or fade easily.
- **Hand Feel:** Outstanding. No additional thickness or texture, maintains fabric hand.
- **Detail Resolution:** Excellent. Photographic quality reproduction with fine details.
- **Wash Fastness:** Superior. Colors maintain vibrancy through repeated washing.
- **Stretch Compatibility:** Perfect. Moves with fabric without cracking or distortion.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Polyester activewear, sportswear, all-over prints, photographic designs, performance apparel.
- **Good:** Polyester-coated substrates, promotional items, custom apparel, team uniforms.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Cotton fabrics, dark-colored garments, natural fiber fabrics.
- **Avoid:** 100% cotton, fabrics with less than 65% polyester content, black or very dark base colors.

## Technical Specifications
- **Fabric Requirements:** Minimum 65% polyester content, preferably 100% polyester.
- **Base Color Limitation:** Light colors only (white, light gray, pastels).
- **Print Resolution:** 300-1440 DPI depending on equipment.
- **Transfer Temperature:** 180-210°C (356-410°F).
- **Transfer Pressure:** Light to medium pressure (15-25 PSI).
- **Transfer Time:** 45-60 seconds typical.
