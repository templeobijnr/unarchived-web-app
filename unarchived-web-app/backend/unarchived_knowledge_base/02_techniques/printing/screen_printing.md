# Profile: Screen Printing

## Overview
Screen printing (silk screening) is a printing technique where ink is pushed through a mesh screen onto fabric. Each color requires a separate screen, making it ideal for designs with few colors and large quantities. It's the most cost-effective method for bulk orders and produces vibrant, durable prints.

## Key Properties
- **Durability:** Excellent. Prints can last hundreds of washes when properly cured.
- **Color Vibrancy:** Excellent. Produces bold, opaque colors that pop off the fabric.
- **Ink Opacity:** Excellent. Can print light colors on dark fabrics effectively.
- **Detail Level:** Good. Can handle medium detail but not fine lines or photographic images.
- **Feel:** Variable. Plastisol inks create a raised feel; water-based inks are softer.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Large quantity orders (100+ pieces), simple designs (1-4 colors), team uniforms, promotional items.
- **Good:** Bold graphics, text-heavy designs, designs requiring opacity on dark garments.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Small quantities (under 24 pieces), complex multi-color designs (8+ colors), photographic images.
- **Avoid:** Rush orders requiring same-day turnaround, designs with fine gradients.

## Technical Specifications
- **Setup Cost:** $15-$45 per color/screen. One-time cost regardless of quantity.
- **Minimum Quantity:** Typically 24-50 pieces for cost effectiveness.
- **Color Limit:** Practically unlimited, but costs increase significantly after 4-6 colors.
- **Print Size:** Up to 14"x16" on standard equipment, larger with specialty presses.

## Manufacturing Considerations
- **Lead Times:** 7-14 days standard, 3-5 days rush (additional cost).
- **Cost Structure:** High setup cost, very low per-piece cost. More economical as quantity increases.
- **Price Range:** $2.50-$8.00 per piece depending on colors, quantity, and garment type.
- **Volume Breaks:** Significant price drops at 100, 250, 500, and 1000+ pieces.

## Ink Types & Applications
- **Plastisol Ink:** Standard choice. Sits on top of fabric, opaque, durable, slight hand feel.
- **Water-Based Ink:** Soaks into fabric, soft feel, eco-friendly, less opacity on dark colors.
- **Discharge Ink:** Removes dye from shirt and replaces with new color, ultra-soft feel.
- **Specialty Inks:** Metallic, glow-in-the-dark, puff, crackle, reflective options available.

## Fabric Compatibility
- **Excellent:** Cotton, cotton blends, polyester (with appropriate inks).
- **Good:** Canvas, denim, synthetic blends.
- **Challenging:** Performance fabrics (may require specialty inks), very stretchy materials.

## Design Considerations
- **Color Separation:** Each color requires a separate screen. Overlapping colors need careful planning.
- **Trap/Choke:** Slight overlap between colors prevents white gaps during printing.
- **Halftones:** Can simulate gradients but requires skilled setup and may not be suitable for all designs.
- **Registration:** Proper alignment of multiple colors is critical for professional results.

## Inter-relationships & Considerations
- **Compatible with:** **Cotton**, **Polyester**, **Cotton-Poly blends**. Different inks work better with different fabrics.
- **Alternative Methods:** Consider **DTG** for small quantities, **Heat Transfer Vinyl** for single pieces, **Sublimation** for all-over prints.
- **Quality Factors:** Proper curing temperature (320Â°F for plastisol), correct squeegee pressure, appropriate mesh count.

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Reduce Colors:** Each additional color adds $15-45 to setup cost.
- **Increase Quantity:** Screen printing becomes very economical at higher volumes.
- **Standard Placements:** Front chest prints are cheaper than multiple locations.
- **Gang Printing:** Multiple designs can be printed simultaneously to reduce costs.

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Ink Cracking:** Usually caused by under-curing or poor ink quality.
- **Color Registration:** Misaligned colors due to screen movement or improper setup.
- **Bleeding:** Colors mixing due to wet-on-wet printing without proper flash curing.
- **Pinholes:** Small holes in print caused by contamination or worn screens.
