# Profile: Direct-to-Film (DTF) Printing

## Overview
Direct-to-Film (DTF) printing is an innovative digital printing technology that prints designs onto a special film, then transfers them to garments using heat and pressure. DTF bridges the gap between DTG and heat transfer vinyl, offering unlimited colors, no minimum quantities, and compatibility with various fabric types including dark colors and synthetic materials.

## Key Properties
- **Color Range:** Unlimited. Full-color designs including gradients and photographic images.
- **Fabric Compatibility:** Excellent. Works on cotton, polyester, blends, dark fabrics, and problem materials.
- **Detail Resolution:** Very Good. Fine details and small text reproduction capability.
- **Setup Costs:** None. Digital process requires no screens or plates.
- **Minimum Quantity:** As low as 1 piece, ideal for samples and small runs.
- **Durability:** Good to Very Good. Proper application provides wash-resistant prints.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Small to medium quantities (1-500 pieces), complex designs, dark garments, synthetic fabrics, promotional items.
- **Good:** Full-color logos, photographic prints, on-demand production, custom names/numbers.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)

- **Avoid:** Applications requiring the softest hand feel, vintage/distressed aesthetics.

## Technical Specifications
- **Print Resolution:** 1440 DPI capable, excellent detail reproduction.
- **Film Types:** Hot-peel and cold-peel films available for different applications.
- **Transfer Temperature:** 160-170°C (320-340°F) typical application temperature.
- **Transfer Pressure:** 40-60 PSI for optimal adhesion.
- **Transfer Time:** 10-15 seconds application time.
