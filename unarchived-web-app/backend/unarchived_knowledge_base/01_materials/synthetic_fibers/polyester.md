# Profile: Polyester

## Overview
Polyester is a synthetic polymer fabric, one of the most widely used textiles in the world. It is known for its exceptional durability, resistance to wrinkles and shrinking, and low cost. Due to its hydrophobic nature, it is a foundational material for performance and athletic apparel.

## Key Properties
- **Durability:** Excellent. Highly resistant to abrasion, stretching, shrinking, and most chemicals. It maintains its strength whether wet or dry.
- **Moisture-Wicking:** Excellent. Polyester fibers are hydrophobic, meaning they repel water. This pushes moisture away from the skin to the fabric's surface where it can evaporate quickly.
- **Wrinkle Resistance:** Excellent. The fibers are resilient and hold their shape well, requiring minimal ironing.
- **Color Retention:** Very Good. Dyes well with disperse dyes, resulting in vibrant, long-lasting colors that resist fading.
- **Odor Retention:** Poor. Can be prone to holding onto bacteria-caused odors, which can be mitigated with antimicrobial treatments.
- **Breathability:** Moderate. Less breathable than natural fibers like cotton, which can feel clammy in non-active situations.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** High-performance activewear, gym clothes, team jerseys, tracksuits, running shirts, and any garment where moisture-wicking is critical.
- **Good:** Outerwear (windbreakers, jackets), everyday apparel (especially when blended with cotton), bags, and upholstery.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Formal dress shirts (low breathability), luxury bedding, or garments intended for high-heat environments (it has a low melting point).
- **Avoid:** Use as a standalone fabric for next-to-skin daily wear if breathability and a natural feel are the top priorities.

## Technical Specifications
- **GSM Range:** Varies widely. Lightweight (130-160 GSM) for running shirts, Heavyweight (250-350 GSM) for hoodies and outerwear.
- **Cost Factor:** Low. Generally one of the most affordable textile options.
- **Common Blends:** **Poly-Cotton** (usually 65/35 or 50/50) for balancing comfort and performance. **Polyester/Spandex** (e.g., 88/12) for adding stretch.
- **Melting Point:** Approximately 250-260°C (482-500°F). Avoid high-temperature ironing.

## Manufacturing Considerations
- **Lead Times:** 2-4 weeks for standard polyester fabrics. Custom colorways add 1-2 weeks.
- **Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs):** Typically 500-1000 yards for standard weights and colors. Custom specifications require 2000+ yards.
- **Price Range:** $1.50-$4.50 per yard depending on weight, finish, and supplier location.
- **Key Suppliers:** China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang provinces), India (Tamil Nadu), Turkey, Vietnam.

## Inter-relationships & Considerations
- **Works Well With:** **Sublimation** printing (the dye bonds directly to the polyester fibers). Often blended with **Spandex** to add four-way stretch for athletic wear.
- **Sustainability Notes:** Conventional polyester is petroleum-based. For a more sustainable option, look for **Recycled Polyester (rPET)**, which is made from post-consumer plastic bottles.
- **Common Issues:** Prone to "pilling" (forming small fiber balls on the surface) with abrasion over time. Can generate static electricity.
