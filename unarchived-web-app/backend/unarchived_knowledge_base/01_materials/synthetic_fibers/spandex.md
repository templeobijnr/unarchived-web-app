# Profile: Spandex (Elastane/Lycra)

## Overview
Spandex is a synthetic polymer fiber known for its exceptional elasticity. It can stretch up to 5-8 times its original length and return to its original shape. Essential for modern apparel requiring stretch and form-fitting properties, spandex is rarely used alone but as a blend component.

## Key Properties
- **Elasticity:** Exceptional. Can stretch 400-700% of original length and recover fully.
- **Recovery:** Excellent. Returns to original shape quickly and repeatedly without permanent deformation.
- **Durability:** Good. Resistant to perspiration, lotions, and detergents when properly cared for.
- **Lightweight:** Very light, adding stretch without significant weight.
- **Chlorine Resistance:** Poor. Degrades quickly in chlorinated water (swimming pools).
- **Heat Sensitivity:** Moderate. Can lose elasticity with high heat; requires gentle care.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Athletic wear, activewear, leggings, shapewear, swimwear (non-chlorinated), compression garments.
- **Good:** Fitted jeans, stretch shirts, undergarments, socks, form-fitting dresses.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Swimwear for chlorinated pools, garments requiring structure without stretch.
- **Avoid:** High-heat processing, bleaching, fabric softeners (can break down fibers).

## Technical Specifications
- **Typical Blend Percentages:** 2-5% in most garments, 10-20% in high-stretch activewear, 15-25% in shapewear.
- **Stretch Types:** Two-way stretch (width or length), Four-way stretch (both directions).
- **Denier Range:** 20-210 denier, with finer deniers for lighter fabrics.
- **Cost Factor:** High. Spandex is expensive compared to other fibers.

## Manufacturing Considerations
- **Lead Times:** 4-6 weeks for standard spandex blends. Specialty elastane may require 6-8 weeks.
- **Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs):** 2000-5000 yards for stretch fabrics due to specialized knitting/weaving.
- **Price Range:** $4.00-$12.00 per yard depending on base fabric and spandex percentage.
- **Key Suppliers:** Invista (Lycra brand), Hyosung (creora), Asahi Kasei (Roica), Chinese manufacturers.

## Spandex Types & Grades
- **Standard Spandex:** Basic elasticity, good for everyday stretch garments.
- **High-Performance Elastane:** Superior recovery and durability for athletic wear.
- **Eco-Friendly Options:** Bio-based spandex from renewable sources (Lycra EcoMade).
- **Specialty Types:** Chlorine-resistant for swimwear, heat-set for shape retention.

## Blend Considerations by Application
- **Activewear:** 88% Polyester + 12% Spandex (moisture-wicking with stretch)
- **Casual Stretch:** 95% Cotton + 5% Spandex (comfort with minimal stretch)
- **Performance Denim:** 98% Cotton + 2% Spandex (structure with movement)
- **Compression Wear:** 80% Nylon + 20% Spandex (high stretch and recovery)

## Inter-relationships & Considerations
- **Compatible Fibers:** Works well with **Cotton**, **Polyester**, **Nylon**, **Rayon**. Each combination offers different properties.
- **Care Requirements:** Wash in cool water, avoid fabric softeners, air dry or low heat tumble dry.
- **Quality Factors:** Recovery percentage (how much stretch returns), cycle life (repeated stretch without failure).
- **Common Issues:** Loss of stretch over time, yellowing with age, damage from chlorine and high heat.

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Volume Benefits:** Larger orders (5000+ yards) can reduce cost by 15-25%.
- **Standard Blends:** Using common ratios (95/5, 88/12) is more cost-effective than custom percentages.
- **Regional Sourcing:** Turkey and India offer good quality at lower costs than premium European suppliers.
