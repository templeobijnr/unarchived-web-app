# Profile: Cotton

## Overview
Cotton is a natural cellulosic fiber derived from the cotton plant's seed pods. It's one of the most versatile and widely used textile fibers globally, prized for its comfort, breathability, and ease of care. Cotton forms the backbone of casual apparel and is essential for everyday clothing.

## Key Properties
- **Breathability:** Excellent. Natural fiber structure allows air circulation, making it comfortable in warm weather.
- **Comfort:** Excellent. Soft hand feel, non-irritating to skin, gets softer with washing.
- **Absorbency:** Very Good. Can absorb up to 27 times its weight in water, making it ideal for towels and undergarments.
- **Durability:** Good. Strong when dry, loses about 20% strength when wet. Improves with quality (long-staple cotton).
- **Wrinkle Resistance:** Poor. Requires ironing or treatment to maintain crisp appearance.
- **Color Retention:** Good. Takes dyes well but may fade over time with washing and sun exposure.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** T-shirts, casual shirts, jeans, underwear, baby clothes, home textiles (towels, bedding).
- **Good:** Workwear, casual dresses, summer garments, canvas bags.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** High-performance athletic wear (retains moisture), formal shirts requiring wrinkle-free appearance.
- **Avoid:** Swimwear, waterproof garments, garments requiring stretch without blending.

## Technical Specifications
- **Fiber Length:** Short staple (13-25mm), Medium staple (25-32mm), Long staple (32-45mm), Extra-long staple (45mm+).
- **GSM Range:** Lightweight (120-160 GSM) for t-shirts, Medium weight (160-220 GSM) for casual shirts, Heavyweight (220-350+ GSM) for jeans and outerwear.
- **Cost Factor:** Medium. Price varies significantly based on quality and origin.
- **Shrinkage:** 3-5% typical shrinkage without pre-shrinking treatment.

## Manufacturing Considerations
- **Lead Times:** 3-6 weeks for standard cotton fabrics. Organic cotton may require 6-8 weeks.
- **Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs):** 1000-3000 yards for standard weights. Premium cotton (Pima, Supima) requires higher MOQs.
- **Price Range:** $2.50-$8.00 per yard depending on quality, origin, and certifications.
- **Key Suppliers:** USA (Supima), Egypt (Giza), India (Gujarat, Maharashtra), China, Brazil, Turkey.
- **Quality Grades:** Middling (standard), Strict Low Middling, Good Middling, Strict Good Middling.

## Cotton Varieties & Quality Levels
- **Regular Cotton:** Standard fiber, good for basic apparel.
- **Pima Cotton:** Long-staple, stronger and softer than regular cotton.
- **Supima Cotton:** Premium long-staple cotton grown in USA, superior strength and softness.
- **Giza Cotton:** Egyptian long-staple, extremely fine and luxurious.
- **Organic Cotton:** Grown without synthetic pesticides, GOTS certified options available.

## Inter-relationships & Considerations
- **Common Blends:** **Cotton-Polyester** (reduces wrinkles, improves durability), **Cotton-Spandex** (adds stretch), **Cotton-Modal** (improves drape and softness).
- **Pre-treatments:** **Mercerization** (improves luster and dye uptake), **Sanforization** (pre-shrinking), **Bio-washing** (softness).
- **Sustainability:** Look for **Better Cotton Initiative (BCI)**, **GOTS Organic**, or **Cradle to Cradle** certified cotton.
- **Common Issues:** Shrinkage, wrinkling, color fading, lint generation.
