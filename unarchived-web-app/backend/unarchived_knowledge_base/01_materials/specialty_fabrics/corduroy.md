# Profile: Corduroy

## Overview
Corduroy is a distinctive textile characterized by raised parallel ridges (called wales) that run vertically along the fabric. Made through a cut-pile weaving process, corduroy offers durability, warmth, and a unique textural appearance. The fabric ranges from fine-wale luxury applications to wide-wale casual wear, making it versatile for both fashion and workwear applications.

## Key Properties
- **Durability:** Excellent. Dense weave structure and pile provide exceptional wear resistance.
- **Warmth:** Very Good. Wales trap air providing insulation without bulk.
- **Texture:** Distinctive. Raised ridges create unique tactile and visual appeal.
- **Breathability:** Good. Despite warmth, allows air circulation between wales.
- **Drape:** Moderate. Structured feel with some body, varies by wale size and weight.
- **Stretch:** Minimal in traditional corduroy; stretch versions available with spandex.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Casual jackets, pants, skirts, shirts, children's clothing, workwear, autumn/winter garments.
- **Good:** Accessories (bags, hats), upholstery, decorative applications, vintage-inspired designs.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Formal business wear, athletic clothing, delicate garments, summer wear in hot climates.
- **Avoid:** Applications requiring smooth texture, high-stretch requirements, minimal bulk.

## Technical Specifications
- **Wale Count:** Measured in wales per inch - determines fineness and appearance.
- **GSM Range:** 200-400 GSM typical for apparel, varies by wale size and base fabric.
- **Fiber Content:** Cotton (traditional), cotton-polyester blends, cotton-spandex for stretch.
- **Pile Height:** 2-6mm depending on wale size and intended application.

## Wale Classifications & Applications

- **Pile Security:** Minimal shedding and good abrasion resistance.
- **Color Fastness:** Resistance to fading, especially important for darker colors.
- **Shrinkage Control:** Pre-shrunk fabrics prevent garment distortion.
- **Base Fabric Integrity:** Strong ground weave to support pile structure.

## Design & Construction Considerations
- **Pattern Layout:** Wales should run vertically for proper garment appearance.
- **Seam Types:** Plain seams acceptable; flat-felled for workwear applications.
