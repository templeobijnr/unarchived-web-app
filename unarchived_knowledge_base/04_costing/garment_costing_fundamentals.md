# Profile: Garment Costing Fundamentals

## Overview
Garment costing is the systematic calculation of all expenses involved in producing a garment, from raw materials to finished product delivery. Accurate costing is critical for pricing strategy, profit margin planning, and supplier negotiations. Understanding cost structure enables informed decision-making throughout the design and production process.

## Key Cost Components
- **Material Costs:** 40-65% of total cost. Includes fabric, trims, labels, packaging.
- **Labor Costs:** 15-35% of total cost. Varies significantly by manufacturing region.
- **Factory Overhead:** 8-15% of total cost. Equipment, utilities, facility costs.
- **Transportation:** 2-8% of total cost. Freight, duties, logistics.
- **Profit Margins:** Factory 8-15%, Brand 50-300% markup typical.

## Best For (Positive Applications)
- **Excellent:** Pre-production planning, supplier negotiations, pricing strategy, margin analysis.
- **Good:** Design decision-making, value engineering, competitive analysis.

## Not Recommended For (Negative Applications)
- **Poor:** Post-production analysis only, ignoring market positioning in pricing.
- **Avoid:** Using generic costing without considering specific design requirements.

## Technical Specifications
- **Costing Accuracy:** Target ±5% accuracy for production costing.
- **Update Frequency:** Costs should be updated quarterly or with significant material price changes.
- **Regional Variations:** Labor costs can vary 300-500% between regions.
- **Currency Impact:** Exchange rate fluctuations can affect costs by 10-20%.

## Material Costing Deep Dive
- **Fabric Cost Calculation:** (Fabric price per yard × Yield per garment) + waste factor (10-15%)
- **Trim Costs:** Buttons, zippers, labels, thread, elastic - typically $0.25-$2.50 per garment
- **Packaging:** Poly bags, hangtags, tissue paper - typically $0.15-$0.75 per garment
- **Yield Calculation:** Fabric consumption varies by garment complexity and size range

## Labor Cost Analysis by Region
- **Bangladesh:** $0.33-$0.68 per hour, total labor cost $0.75-$2.50 per basic garment
- **Vietnam:** $0.68-$1.05 per hour, total labor cost $1.25-$3.50 per basic garment
- **India:** $0.68-$1.40 per hour, total labor cost $1.50-$4.00 per basic garment
- **China:** $2.50-$4.60 per hour, total labor cost $3.50-$8.00 per basic garment
- **Turkey:** $3.20-$5.80 per hour, total labor cost $4.50-$10.00 per basic garment
- **Mexico:** $2.30-$4.10 per hour, total labor cost $3.25-$7.50 per basic garment
- **USA:** $12.00-$18.00 per hour, total labor cost $15.00-$35.00 per basic garment

## Standard Minute Values (SMV) by Garment Type
- **Basic T-shirt:** 12-18 minutes
- **Polo Shirt:** 25-35 minutes
- **Hoodie:** 45-65 minutes
- **Dress Shirt:** 35-55 minutes
- **Jeans:** 22-35 minutes
- **Dress:** 40-80 minutes (varies significantly by complexity)

## Cost Breakdown Examples
### Basic Cotton T-shirt (1000 pieces)
- **Fabric:** $2.25 (0.75 yards × $3.00/yard)
- **Trims:** $0.35 (thread, labels, tag)
- **Labor:** $1.85 (15 SMV in Vietnam)
- **Overhead:** $0.55 (factory overhead, QC)
- **FOB Cost:** $5.00
- **Freight/Duty:** $0.75
- **Landed Cost:** $5.75

### Premium Hoodie (500 pieces)
- **Fabric:** $8.50 (1.8 yards × $4.75/yard premium fleece)
- **Trims:** $2.25 (zipper, drawcord, labels, eyelets)
- **Labor:** $4.50 (55 SMV in Turkey)
- **Overhead:** $1.75
- **FOB Cost:** $17.00
- **Freight/Duty:** $2.25
- **Landed Cost:** $19.25

## Price Volume Relationships
- **Small Quantities (50-250):** 40-60% higher cost due to setup inefficiencies
- **Medium Quantities (250-1000):** Standard costing applies
- **Large Quantities (1000-5000):** 8-15% cost reduction possible
- **Very Large Quantities (5000+):** 15-25% cost reduction through dedicated production

## Seasonal Cost Factors
- **Peak Season (Aug-Oct):** 10-20% premium due to capacity constraints
- **Standard Season (Nov-May):** Normal pricing
- **Slow Season (Jun-Jul):** Potential 5-15% discounts for confirmed orders
- **Chinese New Year (Jan-Feb):** Production delays, potential rush charges

## Inter-relationships & Considerations
- **Fabric Choice Impact:** Premium fabrics can increase total cost by 30-150%
- **Construction Complexity:** Each additional seam/detail adds $0.15-$0.50 to labor cost
- **Quality Level:** Premium construction can add 40-100% to labor costs
- **Sustainability:** Organic/sustainable materials typically add 15-40% to material costs

## Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Fabric Efficiency:** Optimized patterns can reduce fabric cost by 5-12%
- **Trim Standardization:** Using common trims across styles reduces costs
- **Volume Consolidation:** Combining orders with same supplier improves pricing
- **Regional Strategy:** Matching garment complexity to appropriate manufacturing region
- **Timing:** Off-season production can reduce costs significantly

## Hidden Costs to Consider
- **Sample Development:** $50-$200 per style for initial samples
- **Pattern Making:** $200-$500 per style for new patterns
- **Grading:** $150-$350 per style for size range development
- **Quality Issues:** Defects can add 2-8% to total costs
- **Inventory Carrying:** Storage and financing costs for excess inventory

## Margin Structure Analysis
- **Cost of Goods:** 35-55% of wholesale price
- **Wholesale Margin:** Brand takes 45-65% margin
- **Retail Margin:** Retailer takes 50-65% margin (2.0-2.8x wholesale)
- **Final Consumer Price:** Typically 4-6x manufacturing cost
