## Knowledge Base Principles

### Atomicity & Chunkability
Each document section under ## headings serves as a self-contained "Lego brick" of information that can be retrieved independently while maintaining context and relationships.

### Structured & Scannable  
Consistent use of:
- **Bolded keywords** for emphasis and retrieval
- Bulleted lists (-) for scannable information
- ## Headings for logical section organization
- Clear hierarchy from overview to specific details

### Explicit & Unambiguous
- No inference required - all critical information explicitly stated
- Specific cost ranges, lead times, and technical specifications
- Clear best/worst use case definitions
- Quantified performance metrics and quality standards

## AI Optimization Features

### Enhanced Retrieval
- **Keywords & Synonyms** sections optimize search and discovery
- **Inter-relationships** sections connect related concepts across the knowledge base
- Consistent naming conventions and cross-references

### Expert Intelligence
- Real-world cost ranges and volume breaks
- Regional manufacturing intelligence and specializations  
- Quality control standards and common issue resolution
- Seasonal factors and market timing considerations

### Decision Support
- Clear best/not recommended applications
- Cost optimization strategies and volume thresholds
- Risk factors and mitigation approaches
- Technical specifications for informed decision-making
